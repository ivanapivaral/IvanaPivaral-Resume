        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently student at the University of California-Riverside. My name is Ivana and my life is so sick I have a lot of money and I have a huge house. I am telling you now all these other rappers suck. Come into my bed, so me and you can cuddle. I'm the world's dopest puppet, I'm gonna be so rich. I don't like my wife, 'cause she's a big pain. Some people make fun of me, calling me a talking sock. Come say that to my face so I can slap you with my hand.<br><br>

        I enjoy working with children and learning new things as well as practicing new projects. Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush) Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go after the ogre. Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. So you're just gonna bring me a birthday gift to my birthday to my birthday party on my birthday with a birthday gift? A potato flew around my room before you came. Chipotle is my life. Nice Ron, I sneezed, what am I not allowed to sneeze? . My brother's name is Trey and he has a basketball game tomorrow, hes a point guard. I smell like beef. It is Wednesday, my dudes. That was legitness. That's my opinion. Road work ahead? Yeah, I sure hope it does. If your road does not work then I can fix it if that means you hire me. They were roommates. Whoever threw that paper. What are those? You better stop. <br><br>

        My goals are to gain more experience with teaching so that it opens more opportunities for me as a teacher in the future. Is this allowed? I coulda dropped my croissant. Look at all those chickens. Country boy, Ilove you. Hi, Welcome to Chili's. He need some milk. It's and avocado, thanks. Sometimes One day my goal is to marry someone like Bob Duncan.
